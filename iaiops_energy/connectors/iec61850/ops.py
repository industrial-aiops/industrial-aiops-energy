"""IEC 61850 MMS operations — read-only model browse + read (``iec61850`` extra).

IEC 61850 is the substation-automation standard; its MMS mapping lets a client
browse the device's data model (logical devices → logical nodes → data objects)
and read data attributes by object-reference + functional constraint (FC). This
connector is **read-only**: device directory, model browse, and attribute read.
Control (Oper / select-before-operate) is OT-dangerous and NOT exposed here.

All libiec61850 calls are isolated in ``iaiops.connectors.iec61850.driver``
(待核实 — unverified against a live IED). The ops use the adapter's uniform
interface and are mock-testable.
