"""IEC 60870-5-104 operations — read-only telemetry tap (via the ``c104`` extra).

IEC 60870-5-104 is the TCP profile of IEC 60870-5 telecontrol — the workhorse of
electrical substations / SCADA RTUs in the energy sector. This connector is
**read-only monitoring**: connection status, general interrogation (read all
monitored points of a station/ASDU), and single-point reads. Control direction
commands (C_SC/C_DC/C_RC/setpoints) are OT-dangerous and intentionally NOT exposed
in this preview.

``c104`` (iec104-python) is an OPTIONAL extra imported lazily in
:func:`iaiops.core.runtime.connection._build_iec104_client`. The exact binding
surface is documented there and is 待核实 (unverified against a live RTU) — the
ops below duck-type the client/connection/station/point objects so they survive
minor API differences and are fully mock-testable.
